# Shopping Cart Project Management System

<p>In this project, we have developed a user-friendly and efficient shopping cart system 
that allows you to conveniently manage your shopping experience. <br>  With a well structured design, our system comprises three essential classes: Item, Product, and 
Cart. <br> These classes work together harmoniously to provide seamless functionalities 
such as adding items to the cart, viewing the cart's contents, and checking out.
</p>

## ITEM CLASS 
<p>The Item class serves as the foundation for representing individual items within our 
shopping cart.<br> It encapsulates essential attributes like name, price, and quantity. <br> By 
leveraging the Item class, we ensure that each product added to the cart is welldefined and easily manageable.</p>

## PRODUCT CLASS
<p>The Product class plays a pivotal role in organizing and categorizing the items 
available for purchase.<br> It encapsulates attributes specific to each product, such as the 
product ID, description, and any additional details deemed necessary.<br> By utilizing the 
Product class, our shopping cart system maintains a comprehensive and coherent 
inventory of available products.

## CART CLASS
<p>The Cart class serves as the central component of our project. It orchestrates the 
interactions between the user and the shopping cart functionalities.<br> Users can add 
items to their cart, view the cart's contents, and ultimately proceed to the checkout 
process.<br> The Cart class provides a seamless and intuitive experience, making it easier 
than ever to keep track of desired items and manage the purchasing process 
efficiently.
